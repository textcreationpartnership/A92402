            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Title Demonſtrates the Author to be no <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> or not to have obſerved, That an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Sailor, not Saile'r, writ that Paper, Reflecting (as he terms it) on the Admiralty; but however he may have been Concerned; his Carping at filthy Springs from impure Fountains, cannot juſtify the Admiralty which he makes the Fountain; for as <hi>Omne Simile Claudicat,</hi> ſo doth his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, that pure Waters loſe their Virtues by the Channels they flow thro'; except he would have the unalterable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, iſſued from that formerly important Office, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the imprudent or ill Management of thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated by it: This he may be aſſured of, the old Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males of <hi>Wapping,</hi> would not have ſuffered their Servants to commit Faults, without Reproof and Puniſhment; whereas this Author would have the Commiſſioners of the Admiralty to do ſo, And how juſtly the Sea-men living there, complain of the Commiſſioners of the Admiralties Dealings with them, the Author might be judge of, would he hear them, which he knows the Lords of the Admiralty will not, to the Firſt's great Sorrow, and the Latters ever-laſting Infamy.</p>
            <p>How ignorant ſoever we may be what King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Sea-Commanders might have been, the Office of Lord High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>England</hi> is well known, and hath, in the Memory of Man been well Executed, in Compariſon of what hath been in the late War, or ſince the preſent Peace; and that the Miſmanagements complained of, have proceeded from the Qualifications of the Gentlemen that Compoſe that Board, is but too evident; Witneſs the Breach of the Fundamental Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, in the Diſobeying our moſt Gracious King's Commands, ſignified by the Lord

And how can any Fleet ſecure <hi>England,</hi> when it is under the Command of thoſe that did not puniſh Captain <hi>Norris,</hi> for not Attacking of <hi>Poine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

It is true, that the want of the Experience of ſuch Manifeſt Miſcarriages as have happened in the Nine Years War may be happy for the Nation, but except thoſe that are known Guilty of them be puniſhed for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; others, 'tis poſſible will unadviſedly fall into the ſame Errors.</p>
            <p>It is not deſired, That the Length of Service ſhould be a reaſon to Diſplace any Man in Office, but ſurely continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſſervice to their Country and Prince calls for deſerved Puniſhment, and then 'twould be eaſy to name a ſett of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that will Faithfully ſerve the Publick, and render the Admiralty a Renowned, not <hi>An unlucky Office,</hi> an <hi>Epethite</hi> no <hi>Engliſhman</hi> can give to it; however, it may be given to thoſe that Execute it, whoſe Services muſt be forgotten, ſince not known, and their Crimes ought to be remembred, ſince they are ſo evident, and plainly proved every Day.</p>
            <p>The Hardſhips done to the Seamen in Turning them over from one Ship to another, I dare boldly affirm hath been the occaſion of our want of Men; and without a greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard be had to do them Juſtice, both in Pay and Treatment, the Number of the Diſobliged muſt Encreaſe; and who doth not wiſh Eaſe and Advantage to the Seamen, can be no Friend to the Government.</p>

               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let the Cruiſing Captains, in the time of our Grand Fleets being in the Streights be ask'd, <hi>How they were provided with Wine,</hi> and it will appear the Sailors drank Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without ever having their due Allowance for the Wine they ſhould have had, which can be proved; tho' I ſuppoſe the Author of the Obſervations is ignorant thereof.</p>
